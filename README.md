# Obsidian-Hder-snippet
 A CSS snippet that hides alot unwanted UI for a more minimal look


> ### Important‼️
> This project has alot of HARDCODED code so if you have alot of plugins it may not hide everything, I will try to update this snippet to be less HARDCODED over time.



## Installation
1. **Download the Snippet:**
   - [Hider.css](https://github.com/cheaderthecoder/Obsidian-Hider-snippet/blob/main/Hider.css)
   - Place the downloaded CSS file into your Obsidian snippets folder. This is typically found at `\.obsidian\snippets\` on Windows, or `~/Library/Application Support/obsidian/snippets/` on macOS.


2. **Enable the Snippet:**
   - Open Obsidian.
   - Go to `Settings > Appearance > CSS snippets`.
   - You should see the `hider` snippet listed. Toggle it on to apply the style.
